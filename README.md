# Singly Linked List Implementation in Python

This repository hosts a Python-based implementation of a Singly Linked List (SLL), a foundational data structure essential for efficient data management and manipulation. It includes comprehensive functionalities encapsulated within two main classes: `SLLNode` and `SinglyLinkedList`, aimed at providing an educational insight into the operation of linked lists.

## Features

### SLLNode
Represents an individual node in the list, encapsulating the node's value and a reference to the subsequent node.

### SinglyLinkedList
Provides a suite of operations to manipulate the singly linked list, including:

- **Initialization**: Establishes an empty list.
- **Push**: Appends a new node with a specified value to the list's end.
- **ToString**: Generates a string representation of the list, illustrating the sequence of node values.
- **Length**: Computes the total number of nodes in the list.
- **SumList**: Calculates the aggregate of all node values.
- **Remove**: Erases the first node in the list that matches a given value.
- **RemoveAll**: Eliminates all nodes matching a specified value.
- **Search**: Identifies whether at least one node contains a specific value.
- **Count**: Tallys the number of times a given value appears in the list.
- **ShowEncrypted (Reverse)**: Reverses the sequence of nodes in the list. Despite its name, it performs a conventional list reversal.
